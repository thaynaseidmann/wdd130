    <p>Hello everyone! Let me introduce myself.</p>I'm married for 5 years to my amazing husband Jacó. We have 2 wonderful children.
    I am from Minas Gerais, Brazil, but we are currently living in Campinas, São Paulo.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since I was 18 years old. I served a Mission in Maceió, Brazil.
    I really love the church and all the things I have been learning since I became a member.</p>
    <p>Those things make me a better person and are really helpful to my family.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am just taking care of my children (they are toddlers) and studying this amazing course.</p>
    <P>I am so grateful to be a student at BYU from home and so excited to continue developing my skills.</p>
    <p>I wish a wonderful path to everyone and hope we can overcome all the difficulties. You can count on me!</p>
